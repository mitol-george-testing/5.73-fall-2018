  "course_description": "This course presents the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics: wave properties, uncertainty principles, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and operator and matrix methods. Key topics include commutation rule definitions of scalar, vector, and spherical tensor operators; the Wigner-Eckart theorem; and 3_j_ (Clebsch-Gordan) coefficients. In addition, we deal with many-body systems, exemplified by many-electron atoms (\u201celectronic structure\u201d), anharmonically coupled harmonic oscillators (\u201cintramolecular vibrational redistribution: IVR\u201d), and periodic solids.\n",
